T0ast Engine Changelog:
=======================

0.1 - 2023-06-08:
- First version.
- Capable of drawing sprites and tilemaps.

0.1.1 - 2023-06-10:
- Made Draw_Sprite() and Draw_Sprite_Scale() more efficient by immidiately terminating if the sprite is out of view as well as only drawing the parts that are in view.
- Draw_Sprite() and Draw_Sprite_Scale() now return integers. 1 if a sprite is drawn and 0 if a sprite is not drawn.

0.2 - 2024-09-02:
- Credited myself in toast_engine.h.
- Prepared the engine to work as a game engine and general rewriting.
-
- [Added] Node object to prepare for adding game elements.
Node has "*data" variable to hold any arbitrary data.
Node has "**tags" variable to hold any number of tags.
- [Added] Components object to help work with Node.
Components has pointers to all other structs other than Node itself.
- [Added] Transform object to abstract transform operations from other objects.
Transform has "x","y" floats as coordinates. Default is 0.
Transform has "scaleX","scaleY" floats as scale factors. Default is 100.
Transform has "roatation" float. Currently unused.
- [Added] default Transform and Camera macros.
- [Added] "visible" int to Sprite. Currently unused.
- [Added] Transform value to Camera. 
- [Added] Node base value to Camera. Should probably do the same to all nodes at some point.
- [Added] Attach_Components() function to assist in attaching Components to Nodes.
Attach_Components() assigns "components" to "node.data".
- [Added] parameter "transform" to Draw_Tilemap().
- 
- [Removed] "x", "y", and "scale" values from Camera.
- [Removed] transform values from Tilemap.
- [Removed] Draw_Sprite_Scale() until other functions are properly built up.
- [Removed] most of Draw_Tilemap()'s original funtionality. 
- 
- [Edited] Init_Sprite to now set outputSprite as visible.
- [Edited] Draw_Sprite() to be far simpler.
- [Edited] parts of Init_Tilemap() to account for edited struct.
- [Edited] main.c in order to have it work with the new engine version.

0.2.1 - 2024-09-03:
- [Added] "*parent", "**child". and "children" variables in Node. No current functionality.
- [Removed] "base" from Camera. Nodes will be implemented in another way soon.
- [Removed] Draw_Sprite_Camera() prototype. There will be other functions to deal with cameras soon.
- [Edited] DEFAULTCAMERA macro to use DEFAULTTRANSFORM in it.
- Various small edits to comments.

0.2.2 - 2024-09-15:
- Moved includes from toast_engine.c to toast_engine.h.
- Mild cleanup.
- Added simple Coordinate struct.
- Unfinished rotation code.

0.3 - 2024-09-16:
- Init_Sprite is now completely different. Converting the same input sprites into binary.
- Input sprites now have slightly larger headers.
- Draw_Sprite rewritten entirely to draw the new binary format of sprite data. Far faster as a consequence.
- Init_Tileset changed slightly to return an error value if malloc fails.
- Added Font struct to prepare for font support.
- Added Draw_Char and Draw_Text functions to prepare for font support.
- Added DEFAULTCOORDINATE and DEFAULTFONT macros. DEFAULTFONT is unfinished.
- Changed Transform to contain Coordinate structure instead of x and y variables.
- Changed Sprite massively. Now has "visibility" and "opaque" variables. All data is changed to unsigned chars due to binary overhaul.
- Init_Sprite now returns int based on if malloc succeeded or not.
- Init_Tileset now returns int based on if malloc succeeded or not.
- Draw_Sprite now returns void.
- WIP Draw_Text and Draw_Char functions.
- Performance improvements. General code commenting.
- Cleaned up main.c. Main now shows off the drawing and transparency capabilities of Draw_Sprite.

# T0ast-Engine
T0ast is a graphical engine for making Add-Ins for Casio fx-9860 SDK. It will hopefully develop into an actual game engine over time.

Huge thanks to the people over at the Casio Calculator Programming/Projects Discord server for helping my code even work. https://discord.gg/GUayFKqTpG getkey.src and SH4_compatability.h/c came from there.
